<p>Earlier today I read a very interesting blog post from <a href="http://stevesmithblog.com/" target="_blank">Steve Smith</a>. I use FireBug for all of my debugging purposes in Firefox. I wish that IE had a tool as amazing as FireBug. Sadly, I know of none. I had a similar desire for Firefox, because I use Fiddler with IE. That I knew of it wasn't possible to use Fiddler with Firefox. That always annoyed me, because Fiddler is a powerful tool for analyzing HTTP traffic.</p>
<p>It seems Steve was under the same impression as I was. Luckily someone pointed out to him that Firefox can be manually configured to work with Fiddler. Check out Steve's blog post where he details <a href="http://stevesmithblog.com/blog/fiddler-for-firefox/" target="_blank">how to configure Firefox to use Fiddler</a>. Steve has some screen shots and details the steps pretty well.</p>
<p>Thank Steve for posting this!<br />Thank Ivo Evtimov for telling Steve about it!</p>
