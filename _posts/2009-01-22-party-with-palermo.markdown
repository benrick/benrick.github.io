<p>If you've ever gone to a conference and not known what to do on the first night, you should check out <a href="http://www.partywithpalermo.com/" target="_blank">Party with Palermo</a>. Hosted by <a href="http://jeffreypalermo.com/" target="_blank">Jeffrey Palermo</a>, these parties are a good time. Free finger food, free swag, and free drink. The next one is for <a href="http://mvpsummit2009.partywithpalermo.com/" target="_blank">Alt.Net and the MVP Summit</a>. On the first day of March 2009 from 7:00 PM until 10:00 PM the party will be at <a href="http://www.jilliansbilliards.com/" target="_blank">Jillian's</a> 731 Westlake Ave N, Seattle, WA 98109.</p>
<p>The event is fun and easy to attend. <a href="http://mvpsummit2009.partywithpalermo.com/" target="_blank">Palermo wants people to RSVP on his site</a>. Even if you don't respond, you can still show up. The price of admission is one business card. It is easy and will give you a fun event to attend.</p>
<p>If you are not going to be there at that time, don't worry there will be other parties with Palermo later.</p>
