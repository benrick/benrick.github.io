We decided on a format for the group, planned how we were going to organize the events, and came up with some topics to discuss for our first meeting since we didn’t expect people to arrive for the first meeting with lightning talks and discussion topics prepared. We also came up with the time for the meeting which would be the third Wednesday of each month, and we set up the <a href="http://hudsonsc.com/meetings/first-meeting-19-august-2009/" target="_blank">first meeting of the group</a>.</p>  <p>Since that point we have been very impressed with the core group of members who have stepped up to take part in the group and really help improve their own and others’ craft. We put on a local <a href="/post/Software-Engineering-101-Cleveland-Slides-and-Demos/" target="_blank">Software Engineering 101 event in Cleveland</a> where four HudsonSC members, <a href="http://twitter.com/ardalis" target="_blank">@ardalis</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/brendoneus" target="_blank">@brendoneus</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/kevinkuebler" target="_blank">@kevinkuebler</a>, and <a href="http://twitter.com/ropog" target="_blank">@ropog</a>, took the time to discuss some topics and run the group in exercising their skills. The class was a great success and I, as a member of HudsonSC was proud to be a part of it.</p>  <p>The group is always looking for new members, so if you’re in the Northeast Ohio area, please drive to Hudson, Ohio once a month on the third Wednesday of the month. We prefer if you sign up, but you can just show up and we will not turn you away. Everyone is welcome.</p>  <p><a href="http://hudsonsc0810.eventbrite.com/" target="_blank">Sign up for the August 2010 event now!</a></p>  <p>Look for more information on the group on the <a href="http://hudsonsc.com/" target="_blank">Hudson Software Craftsmanship</a> site.</p>  <p></p>  <p>Fresh opinions, ideas, and technology are always welcome.</p>  <h3>Thank you for a great year, HudsonSC!</h3>
