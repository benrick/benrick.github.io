<p>If you’re attending CodeMash 2015, you should join me on Wednesday for <a href="http://brendan.enrick.com/post/Speaking-at-CodeMash-2015" target="_blank">my precompiler workshop</a> (even if you attended <a href="http://brendan.enrick.com/post/CodeMash-2014-Software-Craftsmanship-Precompiler-Workshop" target="_blank">my workshop last year</a>). We’ll be spending the whole day improving our skills, learning about software craftsmanship, and pairing up on programming exercises designed to help you improve the way you learn and practice your coding skills.</p>  <p>If you’ve never attended a software craftsmanship event before, you really should. The entire goal is making sure that you have fun and are able to continue learning more after you leave the event.</p>  <p>For those lucky few of you staying in the Kalahari (still unlikely, since you would have to bribe someone to have even gotten one), I’ve included a set of directions for how to get straight to the Software Craftsmanship Precompiler.</p>  <p><a href="http://brendan.enrick.com/image.axd?picture=SoftwareCraftsmanshipPrecompilerDirections.png"><img title="SoftwareCraftsmanshipPrecompilerDirections" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="SoftwareCraftsmanshipPrecompilerDirections" src="http://brendan.enrick.com/image.axd?picture=SoftwareCraftsmanshipPrecompilerDirections_thumb.png" max-width="100%" /></a></p>  <p>If you eat breakfast in the dining hall before the workshop, we’re just outside of there. </p>  <h3></h3>  <h3>What to Bring</h3>  <p>Bring a laptop if you have one. </p>  <p>Try to have an IDE to write some code in. Choose a language you’re familiar with or want to become more familiar with. It doesn’t matter!</p>  <p>Make sure that you have a testing framework and test runner of some kind. As long as you can write unit tests with it, you’re good. </p>  <p><strong>If you’re not sure how to get these things set up, show up early and talk with us. We’ll help if we have the time and correct expertise or we’ll find someone who does!</strong></p>
