<p>I’ve got a <a href="http://pluralsight.com/training/Courses/TableOfContents/github-windows-developers" target="_blank">Pluralsight course about using GitHub</a> that will be going live this Tuesday, so I thought I would post a few quick tips to help anyone using GitHub or GitHub for Windows and also promote my course.</p> <p>I thought I would start out these posts with a very simple time saver. When you’re typing your commit message, you can just click enter to commit your changes.</p> <p><a href="/images/files/ClickEnterToCommit_1.png"><img title="Click Enter To Commit" style="border-left-width: 0px; max-width: 100%; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Click Enter To Commit" src="/images/files/ClickEnterToCommit_thumb_1.png"></a> </p> <p>If you’re including additional information in a description, clicking enter will just give you a new line like so.</p> <p>&nbsp;<a href="/images/files/EnterNewLineDescription_1.png"><img title="EnterNewLineDescription" style="border-left-width: 0px; max-width: 100%; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="EnterNewLineDescription" src="/images/files/EnterNewLineDescription_thumb_1.png"></a> </p> <p>I hope knowing this will keep you from having to move your hands from your keyboard, and if you want to learn more about GitHub, <a href="http://pluralsight.com/training/Courses/TableOfContents/github-windows-developers" target="_blank">check out my GitHub course</a>! This tip is not mentioned in my course, so you’ll need to watch it to learn more.</p>
