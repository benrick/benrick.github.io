<p>I've recently written a beginner's article explaining what partial classes are and how to use them. My <a href="http://aspalliance.com/1536_Understanding_and_Using_Partial_Classes_in_C" target="_blank">Partial Classes Tutorial</a> walks you through how how partial classes work, how to create partial classes, when one would use partial classes, and a few other bits of useful information. If you don't know much about partial classes I recommend you read the article it has some useful information in it. If you have any partial class question either ask me here or comment on the article. I will be happy to answer questions.</p>
<p>As always, thank you very much for reading.</p>
