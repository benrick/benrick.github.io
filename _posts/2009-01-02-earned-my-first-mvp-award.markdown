<p>A couple of days ago I received an email informing me that I received the 2009 Microsoft&reg; MVP Award.</p>
<p>Thanks Microsoft. I am very honored.</p>
<p>Thank you everyone who reads the articles and blog posts I write as well as the other things I am involved in.</p>
<p>I hope everyone has a happy new year. Everyone at my office should not worry, because I am not really going to uphold the random resolution I mentioned in my <a href="http://brendan.enrick.com/blog/my-randomly-selected-new-year-s-resolution/" target="_blank">previous post</a>.</p>
<p>The year 2009 is turning out well. I hope everyone has enjoyed their first couple of days of the new year.</p>
