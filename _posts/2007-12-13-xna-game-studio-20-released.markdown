<p>So I've dropped the ball on XNA. I've been meaning to read and learn about XNA for a while now. Microsoft has done something truly revolutionary here. They're taking efforts to encourage the little guy to write games for their console. As far as I know, they're the first console to do this. Please correct me if I am wrong about that. I'll get to the point now. Microsoft released a new version of <a href="http://creators.xna.com/Education/GettingStarted.aspx" target="_blank">XNA Game Studio</a> which is the development environment for working with XNA games. I'm a version behind...</p>
<p>XNA Game Studio Express works along side Visual Studio 2005. In previous version I don't think you were able to use anything except for the C# Express Edition. According to the XNA web site, the new version supports the following versions of Visual Studio.</p>
<ul>
<li>Visual C# 2005 Express Edition</li>
<li>Visual Studio 2005 Standard Edition</li>
<li>Visual Studio 2005 Professional Edition</li>
<li>Visual Studio 2005 Tools for the Microsoft Office System</li>
<li>Visual Studio 2005 Team Edition for Software Architects</li>
<li>Visual Studio 2005 Team Edition for Software Developers</li>
<li>Visual Studio 2005 Team Edition for Software Testers</li>
<li>Visual Studio 2005 Team Edition for Database Professionals</li>
<li>Visual Studio 2005 Team Suite</li>
</ul>
<p>They also have some <a href="http://creators.xna.com/Education/StarterKits.aspx" target="_blank">nifty cool starter kits</a> for those of you who hate beginning projects from scratch. They should also be very helpful while learning to develop games using XNA. There are also <a href="http://creators.xna.com/Education/Tutorials.aspx" target="_blank">tutorials</a> and <a href="http://creators.xna.com/Education/Articles.aspx" target="_blank">articles</a> on the site which should help us along while learning XNA.</p>
<p>For those of you who somehow missed XNA completely, it is a game development framework. It helps you develop games for Windows as well as Xbox 360.</p>
<p>Now that I've got an Xbox 360 I think I'll finally hop on board if I get the chance. I am only one major version behind on this one.</p>
