Stop asking to send me notifications! I don't want them! I also don't want to tell your site my location.

Are you tired of being asked if sites can send you notifications or get your location? Yeah, me too. Let's fix that.

## How to Stop Sites In Chrome Asking to Send Notifications or Location

Open up Chrome, and look for the 3 dots in the upper right corner of the window. That will open up the options menu that looks like this.

From that menu, click on `Settings` seen here:

Once on the settings screen, you'll see a search bar like this. Click into it.

Type the word "notifications" into the search to yield results like this.

From here, you'll want to open up the `Site Settings` section of the results, highlighted here. Notice that the search is also indicating that it found results in there.

In the `Site Settings` screen, you'll find a section called `Permissions`, which is where we'll be making our changes.

Two sections in `Permissions` matter to us, the `Location` and `Notification` sections. Open up the `Notifications` first.

### Disabling Chrome Notification Request Permissions

On the `Notifications Permissions` screen, you'll likely find these settings (the default).

To remove the permissions from all sites asking to send notifications, select the `Don't allow sites to send notifications` option, which will prevent sites from even asking to send notifications.

Now click the back button to also remove `Location Request` permissions.

### Disabling Chrome Location Request Permissions

Open up the `Location Permissions` screen, and you'll likely find these settings (the default).

To remove the permissions from all sites asking to request your location, select the `Don't allow sites to see your location` option, which will prevent sites from even asking to know your location.
