<p>Something quite horrible happened to me today. While I was working on some of my code, I accidentally hit some keys while holding the control key down. Unfortunately for me I did not see the keys I hit. Well now instead of seeing whitespace there were this little dots. I figured there was some checkbox in Visual Studio&rsquo;s options. I could not find it anywhere, but I did discover a cool hack. In the fonts section, I found it keeps font information for Visible Whitespace. By&nbsp;changing the font color to white,&nbsp;I wouldn&rsquo;t have to see the dots anymore or so I thought. Whenever I highlighted one of the dots I could see it again.</p>
<p>Now with my frustration building, what can I say I hate dots, I began trying different keyboard shortcuts. I eventually found what turns on and off white space.</p>
<p><strong>The Answer</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Control + E + S</strong></p>
<p>Hopefully no one else must suffer through the horror that is visible white space.</p>
