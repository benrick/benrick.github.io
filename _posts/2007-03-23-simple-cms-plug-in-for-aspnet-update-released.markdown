<p>Yesterday, I updated my <a href="http://aspalliance.com/simplecms/" target="_blank">SimpleCMS plug-in for ASP.NET</a>. It is a free&nbsp;CMS designed to be different from most content management systems. It is not supposed to include tons of features and be some bloated system. It is designed to be an add-on for an existing site.</p>
<p>Check it out. It is&nbsp;free at <a href="http://aspalliance.com/" target="_blank">ASPAlliance.com</a>. This new release uses the RTM builds of the <a href="http://ajax.asp.net/" target="_blank">MS AJAX Library</a> and the <a href="http://ajax.asp.net/ajaxtoolkit/" target="_blank">AJAX Control Toolkit</a>.</p>
<p>If this sounds like something you might be interested in, then check it out. Let me know how you like it and any suggestions you have for it. Just don't ask for it to become like the huge content management systems. There are plenty of those out there give one of those a shot if that is what you are looking for.</p>
