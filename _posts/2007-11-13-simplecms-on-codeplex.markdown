<p>A couple of weeks ago <a href="http://stevesmithblog.com/" target="_blank">Steve Smith</a> and <a href="http://aspadvice.com/blogs/name/default.aspx" target="_blank">I</a> released <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/SimpleCMS" target="_blank">SimpleCMS</a>&nbsp;as an open source project on <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">CodePlex</a>. SimpleCMS is, as the name suggests, a Simple Content Management System. It is&nbsp;a small ASP.NET 2.0 Plug-in which allows dynamic creation of simple pages. I've not gotten much opportunity to work on it in a long time, but I did manage to get&nbsp;enough time to&nbsp;put&nbsp;it on CodePlex.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main goal of SimpleCMS is to be simple. It isn't&nbsp;designed to support a lot of features or be bloated. It is designed to be lightweight. I recommend checking it out if you get the chance. The project could use some more development, and if I get the free time I'll try to work on it a bit.</p>
<p>Let me know what you think about SimpleCMS.</p>
