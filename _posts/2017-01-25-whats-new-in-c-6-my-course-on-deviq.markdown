<p>As a consultant, I’ve worked with developers in different companies, and I find that most organizations are barely using the features of C# 5 let alone using C# 6. When I talk at conferences, most people say they’re using C# 6, and they technically are using it. Their code is compiled using C# 6, but they’re not using all of the features or know how powerful they can be!</p> <p><strong>To help teams with this, I created a quick-start, <a href="http://app.deviq.com/courses/whats-new-in-c-6" target="_blank">What’s New in C# 6</a> course on DevIQ that will help you get started using C# 6!</strong></p> <h3></h3> <h3>What You Will Learn</h3> <p>In the course, you will learn about:</p> <ul> <li>Property and Method Improvements  <li>String Improvements  <li>In-Line Code Improvements  <li>Exception Improvements</li></ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><a href="http://app.deviq.com/courses/whats-new-in-c-6"><img title="Whats New In C# 6" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="Whats New In C# 6" src="/images/files/WhatsNewInCSharp6.png" width="500" height="280"></a></p>
