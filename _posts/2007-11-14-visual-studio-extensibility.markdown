<p>While I was at <a href="http://www.devconnections.com/" target="_blank">DevConnections</a> last week, I watched an interesting demo&nbsp;showing off&nbsp;Visual Studio's extensibility.&nbsp;In the demo the visual studio shell is being used to edit Lua script; the scripting language used by <a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/index.xml" target="_blank">World of Warcraft</a> for designing custom interfaces. The demo showcased Visual Studio's flexibility and captured the audience's attention pretty well.</p>
<p>The speaker added an interesting interface into World of Warcraft which showed images and played sounds when she killed enemies. I think it will be nice to use Visual Studio for almost any programming language. The familiar environment will make things easier. Perhaps more&nbsp;add-ons for Visual Studio will be available in the near future. This WoW Lua add-on is supposed to be available on <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">CodePlex</a>&nbsp;soon.</p>
<p>I don't play World of Warcraft, so I will be waiting to see what extensions other people will decide to make.</p>
