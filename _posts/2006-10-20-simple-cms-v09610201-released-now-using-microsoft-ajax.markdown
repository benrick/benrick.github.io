<p>Microsoft just&nbsp;released their new AJAX Libraries, so a new version of&nbsp;<a href="http://aspalliance.com/simplecms/">Simple CMS</a> has now been released which uses it.&nbsp;I am watching for new controls especially in the AJAX&nbsp;Control Toolkit to add to Simple CMS in future versions. You can suggest changes for future versions of Simple CMS and also ask questions about it using the <a href="http://aspadvice.com/forums/572/ShowForum.aspx">Simple CMS Forum</a>. Let me know what you think.</p>
<p>I hope everyone is keeping up with all the cool features in the MS AJAX. I hope they have some awesome stuff when we get ASP.NET 3.0</p>
