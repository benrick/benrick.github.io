<p>Lately I've been taking a look at dependency injection, and I've spent a little bit of time examining <a href="http://ninject.org/" target="_blank">Ninject</a>. I've read most of the Ninject Documentation, and so far I'm very interested in it. I love that it doesn't depend on configuration files. The "modules" it uses look very interesting. Whenever possible I prefer to use strongly typed everything. I love the compiler and everything it can do for me. I also love intellisense, and not depending on config files helps me to use both of those.</p>
<p>I've heard a little bit about some other dependency injection frameworks including <a href="http://castleproject.org/container/index.html" target="_blank">Windsor</a> and <a href="http://structuremap.sourceforge.net/Default.htm" target="_blank">StructureMap</a>. Not really sure what people are using. I'm pretty well sold on Ninject for now, so if anyone has any opinions or information I need to consider please let me know. I would be glad to hear what other people are using and what their opinions are.</p>
<p>Dependency injection makes a lot of sense, but with a few different choices out there, it is hard to say which route someone should take. I also like the fact that ninject seems to be a lot lighter weight than some other frameworks. In general I prefer add-ins which have very small footprints. If there is one thing I can't stand it is code that dominates everything else.</p>
