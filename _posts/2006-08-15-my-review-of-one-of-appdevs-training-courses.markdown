<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t worry. I am still around, and&nbsp;I have just written my review of <a href="http://www.appdev.com/" target="_blank">AppDev</a>&rsquo;s Professional Training via DVD-ROM course called <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.appdev.com/prodfamily.asp?catalog%5Fname=AppDevCatalog&amp;category%5Fname=CS05Product" target="_blank">Microsoft&reg; Visual C#&reg; 2005: Developing Applications</a></span>. It was a very good course, and I would recommend it to others. My review is&nbsp;called <span id="title"><a href="http://aspalliance.com/963">Review: AppDev Visual C# 2005: Developing Applications</a>. To write the article, all I had to do was go to <a href="http://aspalliance.com/">ASP Alliance.com</a>&nbsp;and click on the link entitled <a href="http://aspalliance.com/writeForUs.aspx">Write for Us</a>. From there I was able to submit a request for the article. It was accepted shortly afterwards, and I soon after started writing the article by following their set of article <a href="http://aspalliance.com/guidelines.aspx">guidelines</a>. For those of you who read my blog, expect to&nbsp;read more of my&nbsp;articles on <a href="http://aspalliance.com/">ASP Alliance</a>.</span></p>
