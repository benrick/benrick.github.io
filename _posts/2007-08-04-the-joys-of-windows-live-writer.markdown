<p>I've just downloaded and started trying out windows live writer, and I think it is excellent. This has got to be just about the easiest and best program for blog writing I've ever seen.</p>
<h3><strong>Features I love</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>View Web Preview - This view actually shows me what the blog is going to look like and it actually shows it with my blog there including the content from the left column and the previous blog posts beneath this one. </li>
<li>The generated html is reasonably well formed. </li>
<li>I can type in my tags without having to have added them to the blog in advance. </li>
<li>Plug-ins, plug-ins, and more plug-ins. I haven't looked at it but I am assuming that it is easy to write plug-ins for Live Writer. </li>
<li>Inserting Images, Tables, and Maps is incredibly easy. </li>
<li>I have no trouble finding what I need in the toolbar even with my plug-ins installed. </li>
<li>Auto-saving my blog posts as drafts as I type. </li>
<li>Insert link has a button to select a <a href="http://brendan.enrick.com/post/Generic-List-AddRange-Remove-and-Count-Performance.aspx">previous post</a>&nbsp;so rather than finding that post somewhere and copying the link I just found it in this application. </li>
<li>I can also save my links from within the insert link window. </li>
<li>Formatting is simple and easy (unlike other programs which I have used).</li>
</ul>
<p>Ok I give up. I refuse to write any more about how great this program is. Now is the time for me to go and look at some more of these plug-ins. I recommend you go and <a href="http://writer.live.com/">download Windows Live Writer</a> and blog away.</p>
