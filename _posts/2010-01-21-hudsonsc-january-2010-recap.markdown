<p>Last night we had a great HudsonSC meeting. People started showing up around 5:30, and I had the opportunity to meet and talk with a few new attendees during that time.</p>
<h3>Lightning Talks</h3>
<p>At around 6:00 we got things started. <a href="http://twitter.com/kevinkuebler" target="_blank">Kevin Kuebler</a> started us off with an interesting talk on BDD where he showed some interesting code using MSpec. As usual, he was unable to keep his talk under 10 minutes. We will not fault him for that though, since he discussed the topic well and showed some cool code.</p>
<p>Following Kevin&rsquo;s talk, we had a well-timed talked from <a href="http://twitter.com/yasirdrabu" target="_blank">Yasir Drabu</a> about the <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/unitOfWork.html" target="_blank">Unit of Work</a> pattern, which I in no way pressured him into giving at the last minute. Yasir let us know that he was currently implementing this, and he would show us the eventual implementation at a later meeting.</p>
<h3>Open Spaces</h3>
<p>Our open space discussions start at the same time pizza arrives, so people can sit around eating pizza and discussing interesting topics. The selected topics of the evening were &ldquo;How to promote agile practices at your workplace&rdquo; and &ldquo;Automated build processes&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll defer to someone else about how the agile practices open space went, but I do believe the build processes discussion was interesting. Continuous integration, build automation scripts, and database change management were the hot topics of discussion among that group.</p>
<h3>Coding Exercises</h3>
<p>As usual we finished up the meeting with some time spent pair programming through some coding exercises. This time we took our second group attempt through our customized version of <a href="http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?KataPotter" target="_blank">KataPotter</a>.</p>
<p>We had a few interesting solutions to the exercise, and each one handled the optimization for getting the price down differently. They all seem to work effectively according to the unit tests. I know my solution was very different from the previous one I used to solve this exercise.</p>
<p>In Northeast Ohio? Come to HudsonSC the third Wednesday of each month in Hudson, Ohio.</p>
