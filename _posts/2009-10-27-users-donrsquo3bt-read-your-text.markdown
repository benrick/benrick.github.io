<p>A few days ago Jeff Atwood wrote a <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001306.html" target="_blank">great post about users</a>. This is my post adding to his.</p>
<p>I also develop applications, and user interfaces is a common topic of discussion. The interface of an application is one of the most important aspects of it. What a lot of people seem not to realize and Jeff nicely highlights is that users don&rsquo;t read <em>anything</em>. Trust me. I use a lot of applications, and I avoid reading anything that is more than six or seven letters long.</p>
<p>If I have to read something to use an application you&rsquo;re probably going to lose me. I am not here to learn your application I am here to <em>use</em> your application. Jeff shows this image as what a user sees on Stack Overflow when writing a question.</p>

<p>I think he is a little bit off here. Why? Oh I don&rsquo;t know, because he includes the preview. I <em>might</em> look at the preview, but only if I am concerned about how something is formatted. If I don&rsquo;t think I did anything complicated I don&rsquo;t bother checking the preview. I figure I should be able to use this page while only really reading this section.</p>

<p>When I need to reference something I will find it on the page. However, the 90% case is going to be this. I&rsquo;ll make a decision if I need to look elsewhere, and I&rsquo;ll be annoyed when I have to.</p>
<p>I use Stack Overflow and I think the interface is great Jeff. You support standard keyboard shortcuts, so I can learn what they do and how to format them by only observing the editor and occasionally the preview section. When I need a list I know to use the buttons at the top. Anything that is a standard convention I will follow. You give me a toolbar of choices and keyboard shortcuts and I&rsquo;m set.</p>
<p>I think it is most important to follow common practice if you want things right. I am not sure why people have such trouble with Stack Overflow&rsquo;s editor.</p>
