The <a href="http://www.toughestdeveloperpuzzleever.com/" target="_blank">Toughest Developer Puzzle Ever</a> started last year, and you can do either of the puzzles. I recommend tackling TDPE 2 if you haven&rsquo;t done either one yet. There will be prizes sent out to the first 100 people to finish the puzzle, so get solving! Very few people have solved the puzzle so far.</p>
<p>TDPE Classic was created mostly by <a href="http://jeffblankenburg.com/" target="_blank">Jeff Blankenburg</a> with assistance from <a href="http://codinggeekette.com/" target="_blank">Sarah Dutkiewicz</a> and me. The puzzle ended up being 30 levels, and I it was a challenging set of puzzles. It was great fun working on it, and solving the puzzles was also a blast.</p>
<p>This year, we kicked things up a notch. We made harder puzzles, we made more puzzles, and we got extra help working on them. If you were looking for a challenge, I think we have a good one this year.</p>

<p>And to help you on your way I&rsquo;ll give you some advice.</p>
<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t believe everything you see in the puzzle.</li>
<li>A puzzle may seem tedious even when it isn&rsquo;t.</li>
<li>There may be more than one way to solve a puzzle.</li>
<li>Find all available clues, not just the obvious ones. </li>
<li>Use your head.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope you enjoy the puzzle! Good luck!</p>
