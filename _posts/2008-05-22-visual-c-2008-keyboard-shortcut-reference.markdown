<p>As I've said <a href="/post/Differences-Between-Structures-and-Classes-in-C.aspx" target="_blank">previously</a>, I am working with developers who are just beginning to learn the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Visual_Studio" target="_blank">tools</a> of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_Server_Management_Studio" target="_blank">trade</a>. They have a long way to go working with plenty of applications. All people always have more they can learn, so I'll pass along a useful reference here. I found this great reference sheet from Microsoft that has a bunch of key-bindings for Visual C# 2008. It is a PDF poster you can use to reference different shortcuts available to you.</p>
