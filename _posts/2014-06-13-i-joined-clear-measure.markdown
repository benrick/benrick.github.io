<p>I am just about to finish up my second month on the <a href="http://www.clear-measure.com/" target="_blank">Clear Measure</a> team, and I am still very impressed with what this team has built considering how young the company is. I&rsquo;ve known <a href="http://jeffreypalermo.com/" target="_blank">Jeffrey Palermo</a>, one of Clear Measure&rsquo;s founders, for plenty of years, and I decided to jump at the chance to work with him and his team. It is an opportunity that I could not pass on.</p>
<h2>Role Change</h2>
<p>Many developers who have worked with me in the past are excited to learn that I am now getting to write a lot more code than I did before, since I&rsquo;ve stepped out of a leadership position and have taken on a Principal Software Engineer role with Clear Measure.</p>
<p>I am looking forward to the chance to delve back into the world of coding more. I&rsquo;ve been able to write quite a bit of code while leading my teams, but this will give me the chance to get back to what I love. I&rsquo;d been looking for a chance to make this change back to development for a while. I don&rsquo;t expect that anyone can keep me permanently out of a leadership role, but I am in the industry for the development.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been leading development teams for <a href="http://ardalis.com/" target="_blank">Steve Smith</a> and <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/michelle-smith/0/915/360" target="_blank">Michelle Smith</a> for quite a few years, while we were running <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090823073425/http://nimblepros.com/" target="_blank">NimblePros</a> and while we were <a href="http://telerik.com/" target="_blank">Telerik</a> Services. Easily the most difficult decision I&rsquo;ve made in my entire career has been to part ways with them, primarily because it seems like such a big mistake to stop working with them. I am sure that this is not the last time I will work with those two. In fact, I am already discussing some plans for a side project with Steve.</p>
<h2>Diving in Head First</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been extremely impressed with the speed at which I was able to start writing code with Clear Measure. Many others are impressed to learn that <strong>I was building and running a solution in my first hour at Clear Measure.</strong> That&rsquo;s just awesome.</p>
<p>Additionally, since Clear Measure had just started the project, I was able to get things running the way I wanted them to. The project is running under continuous integration and is a derivative of this <a href="https://bitbucket.org/benrick/iteration-zero" target="_blank">Iteration Zero</a> project. Letting the new guy run loose like that was something I was very happy about. In fact, the entire company seems to be based around the idea that people will make good choices when given the chance. I agree!</p>
<h2>Two Dimensional Brendan</h2>
<p>Now that I am working remotely, my team primarily sees me through a webcam. That&rsquo;s certainly a change! I am a big proponent of having a team that is co-located, but for the right team you make exceptions. I think Clear Measure considers me the exception, and I consider them the exception. I&rsquo;m just glad that we can agree on the situation.</p>
<p>I went from being in spaces like these:</p>
<p><a href="/images/files/Photo%20Jun%2023,%2010%2058%2035%20AM.jpg"><img style="border-left-width: 0px; max-width: 100%; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px" title="Team Room 1" src="/images/files/Photo%20Jun%2023,%2010%2058%2035%20AM_thumb.jpg" border="0" alt="Team Room 1" /></a></p>
<p>Notice the close proximity and lots of pair programming. No walls and everyone is constantly able to share information and ideas.</p>
<p><a href="/images/files/Photo%20Jun%2023,%2010%2059%2033%20AM.jpg"><img style="border-left-width: 0px; max-width: 100%; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px" title="Team Room 2" src="/images/files/Photo%20Jun%2023,%2010%2059%2033%20AM_thumb.jpg" border="0" alt="Team Room 2" /></a></p>
<p>In these buildings:</p>
<p><a href="/images/files/NimblePlex.png"><img style="border-left-width: 0px; max-width: 100%; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px" title="NimblePlex" src="/images/files/NimblePlex_thumb.png" border="0" alt="NimblePlex" /></a></p>
<p>Yep those two buildings are what I like to call &ldquo;The NimblePlex&rdquo;. NimblePros shifted around quite a bit between these two buildings over the years. I had 4 different offices while I was in those buildings! Long stories to explain all of those!</p>
<p>Now I am using this desk:</p>
<p><a href="/images/files/HomeDesk.jpg"><img style="border-left-width: 0px; max-width: 100%; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px" title="HomeDesk" src="/images/files/HomeDesk_thumb.jpg" border="0" alt="HomeDesk" /></a></p>
<p>It works pretty well for me. I made sure to get one that was for work and one that wasn&rsquo;t. I am currently seated about 5-6 feet to the left of where I sit there. That&rsquo;s important to me, having that separation.</p>
<p>For anyone paying attention to these pictures, I&rsquo;ve got a Software Craftsmanship calendar on my desk, a Pluralsight mouse pad, an <a href="http://aspalliance.com/" target="_blank">ASP Alliance</a> coaster, and that&rsquo;s a stack of books in the reflection. Can you identify the books? If you have a copy of the Software Craftsmanship Calendar, you might recognize three stars from this year&rsquo;s calendar!</p>
<p>I did not expect to be working from home at this point, but it&rsquo;s been interesting. I am able to have much better lunches than I did before. I now take 20 minutes to prepare and eat a salad most days, and I am watching Star Trek on Netflix during that time. I take a full hour for my lunch break though, so I have time to finish the episode while running on a treadmill. It&rsquo;s amazing how much more energy I&rsquo;ve got in the afternoon with this routine. I cannot recommend it enough. In fact, if I do move back into an office, I am looking into having a treadmill there!</p>
<h2>Going Forward</h2>
<p>I am never one who is without goals. If anything, I would say that I have more goals than I could possibly achieve. I&rsquo;ve always thought that a good thing, since it gives me direction.</p>
<p>I am working on and planning some <a href="http://pluralsight.com/" target="_blank">Pluralsight</a> courses, which hopefully will be out soon. I&rsquo;ll keep you posted.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;m sure you figured out, I don&rsquo;t mind working remotely. In fact, it&rsquo;s got some benefits and has been going well. My next goal at Clear Measure (aside from the success of the company and the projects I work on) is to build up an extremely talented team around me. I&rsquo;ve started that process already, and <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/richard-hildebrand/35/99/507" target="_blank">Rich Hildebrand</a> recently joined our team up here.</p>
