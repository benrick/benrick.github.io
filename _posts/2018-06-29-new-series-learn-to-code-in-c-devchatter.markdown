<p>Starting this Saturday, we’ll be doing a new series of streams on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/devchatter" target="_blank">DevChatter</a>. If you’re new to programming, new to C#, or just want to go back to basics on C#, this stream is for you!</p><p>On our channel, we’re normally doing either long-term projects or programming exercises, but we want to get some great educational C# content as well. To that end, we’ll be teaching people how to program using C# on a regular basis. If that’s something interests you, you can find our <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/events/9I5Zdxl4Q_eTUV_QjHxxQg" target="_blank">Learn to Code in C#</a> series on Twitch. From that page you can ask Twitch to remind you of our Learn to Code in C# series. Also, make sure to follow DevChatter on Twitch to get notifications when we go live.</p>
