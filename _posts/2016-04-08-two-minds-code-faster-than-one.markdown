<p> I’m not exactly silent in my belief that pair programming will help our industry, so it should come as no surprise that <a href="http://ardalis.com/" target="_blank">Steve Smith</a> and I paired together on a <a href="https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/pair-programming" target="_blank">Pluralsight course on Pair Programming</a>. It only made sense to me that a course on pair programming would be created by two people. We shared the work on each module of the course, and we think it turned out well.</p> <p>In the course, we cover the theory, practice, benefits, technique, and research of pair programming. From this, we’re trying to make sure that people both know how to pair program effectively and know why it could benefit their team. If you or someone you know has heard of pair programming, I’d recommend watching the course.</p> <p>Given the choice of typing twice as fast or thinking twice as fast, I know I would choose the latter every time. That’s why I always choose to pair program when someone is available to. We accomplish far more together than we do separately. You’ll learn how and why when you watch <a href="https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/pair-programming" target="_blank">Pair Programming</a>.</p> <p><img title="StandingPairing" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline" border="0" alt="StandingPairing" src="http://brendan.enrick.com/image.axd?picture=StandingPairing.jpg" width="644" height="364"></p>
