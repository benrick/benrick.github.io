The event is called <a href="http://codemash.org/">CodeMash</a> and it is located in Sandusky, Ohio. As the CodeMash site describes it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CodeMash is a unique event that will educate developers on current practices, methodologies, and technology trends in a variety of platforms and development languages such as Java, .Net, Ruby, Python and PHP.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hope everyone attending has a safe trip there and has a good time. I look forward to seeing you there. You&rsquo;ll find me at the <a href="http://codemash.org/Precompiler#Craftsmanship" target="_blank">Precompiler Software Craftsmanship workshop</a> as well as at the <a href="http://codemash.org/Sessions#Coding+Dojo" target="_blank">Coding Dojo</a>, which will be open Thursday and Friday in the Banyan room.</p>
<p>I look forward to seeing you all there. If you don&rsquo;t make it out this year, there is always next year. Have a great week everyone!</p>
