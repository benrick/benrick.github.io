<p>No project should be released without some level kom verification. Someone has to test that things are up to some standard. Contrary to the popular belief, this is not just an important task, it's a difficult skill. Many clients I've worked with hire pretty much any person to be a QA tester. The belief here seems to be that anyone can find bugs. Well, they're right, however, they're also terribly wrong about the role testers play in software development. Your QA testers can make or break your development team, and I think many people value the traits that will lead them toward failure.</p>
<p>At this point in my development career, I've worked on internal development projects, external development projects, and "product" development. I've worked on in-house and consulting projects. I've run full teams as well as augmented existing teams. I've worked with good QA testers, mediocre QA testers, and people who log bugs. Not sure which group you're in/working with? By the end of this, you'll know that (and hopefully picked up a few pointers).</p>
<h3>Why QA Testers Are Needed</h3>
<p>One of the biggest concerns I have regarding the success of any project is that people will misunderstand the role of QA testers (and QA testing). The QA testers are part of the development team and enable great work across the whole team. The important thing to remember is that they enable success; they're not there to impede progress. If I can stress only one thing about the them, it's that <strong>the role of QA testers is not to find bugs. </strong>Finding bugs is easy. Remember? Anyone can find bugs. That's why people hire QA testers as entry-level employees and assume that <em>anyone</em>&nbsp;can perform the task.</p>
<p>Your QA team are here to help the developers, designers, and stakeholders create something that everyone will be very proud to have contributed toward. They can do this by making sure that everything is built the way it needs to be, and making sure to not create roadblocks that slow the team.</p>
<h3>Break Down the Walls Between Communication</h3>
<p>As it is with every role on your team, communication is the key to success for QA testers. When the QA testers "throw back" a story or bug fix without discussing it with the developers first, they've failed in their task. When the developers accomplish a story or a bug fix without discussing it with the QA tester before testing, they've failed. When the QA testers evaluate a story or bug fix without confirming the behavior, reasoning, and requirements with a stakeholder/customer, they've failed. When the QA tester finishes testing a story or bug fix and does not show it to the customer (or put it in a queue to be shown), they've failed. I am trying to not focus too much on the negative aspect of things here, but I do want to emphasize that <strong>every action taken by a QA tester should be preceded as well as followed by communication with other members of the development team</strong>.</p>
<h3>Focus on Everything that is Current</h3>
<p>While an entire application needs to be tested, it's important that most of the testing focus be kept in context. Testing the areas of the application that are being actively worked on is the best way to ensure success. Remember that the testers are enabling development. To this end, the tester is making sure that the team get immediate feedback. This means that the tester can ask the developer what was built immediately following the tasks completion. This means that everything is fresh. Ask a developer about details of the code he or she wrote a month ago, and you'll get a mediocre response. Ask them about what they built 20 minutes ago, and you'll get a clear answer.</p>
<p>Keeping this focus will prevent a few things that we want to avoid.</p>
<p>We don't want to have a huge pile of bugs relating to aspects of the system where we're not focusing attention. This can cause context switching and thashing. Yes, those areas need testing as well, but you've already spent time testing them. The important thing now is to focus where attention is currently being placed. This is where you can provide the most, current benefit to the team. Your watchful eyes will keep things completing. If that pile of bugs gets too large, the team will lose focus and have trouble maintaining its good pace. If things start piling up, make sure you're keeping the list pruned. Talk with the stakeholders to make sure that bugs you're filing are important. Don't be afraid to eliminate some bugs you've found. Remember, if they're important enough, you will find them again later. The system may change completely before the bug is even addressed.</p>
<p>When you're working in less familiar territory, it's easy create a duplicate bug. If you've forgotten or don't know that bug's already found, it's easy to file a bug's twin. Another tester may have phrased things differently, making it difficult to avoid the duplicate. When everyone switches sections of the application, a context switch will refresh everyone's mind on previously filed bugs (avoiding this scenario more often).</p>
<p>Even though you may check with the stakeholder, not everyone will remember what features have been completed. It's easy to create bugs, which are actually feature requests. If someone believes that a feature exists, but it was never completed, a bug may be filed by mistake. It's possible that there was a good reason (possibly a priority change) that left that feature incomplete. Either way, it's not your responsibility to file feature requests. The same as we said for filing too many bugs, <strong>if it's important, it will come up again.</strong></p>
