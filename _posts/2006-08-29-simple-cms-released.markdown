<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; After much anticipation, I am sure, from my zealous readers, I offer to you <a href="http://aspalliance.com/simplecms/default.aspx">Simple CMS</a>. This is a simple content management system, hence the name, which plugs into existing applications. This ASP.NET 2.0 plug-in is not meant to be a full blown application. This is for someone who has a site, and wants to easily add content to the site. With <a href="http://aspalliance.com/simplecms/default.aspx">Simple CMS</a> you can through a web interface create content for you pages, and control the addresses of these pages within your site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://aspalliance.com/simplecms/default.aspx">Simple CMS</a> is currently in Beta, but support will be offered most prominently through the Simple CMS Forum, which is also where I would like people to let me know of any features they would like to see in later versions. I already know of some large changes I plan to make for&nbsp;<a href="http://aspalliance.com/simplecms/FutureVersions.aspx">future versions of Simple CMS</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope you enjoy Simple CMS, and you can expect some articles to be written and posted on <a href="http://aspalliance.com/">ASPAlliance.com</a> about how I made Simple CMS. I will probably write these as separate articles about interesting and useful topics I employed in the creation of my content management system. If you think Simple CMS is cool, you should also check out this <a href="http://aspalliance.com/cachemanager">Cache Manager</a> on which Simple CMS is loosely based. It is a very useful little tool.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Steve Smith did a nice <a href="http://aspadvice.com/blogs/ssmith/archive/2006/08/28/Free-.NET-CMS-Plugin-ASPAlliance.SimpleCMS-Launched.aspx">release post for Simple CMS</a> yesterday, so rather than duplicate the content I will just link to his post.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for reading my Blog. Keep reading it and maybe you will get a free cookie, but you probably won&rsquo;t.</p>
