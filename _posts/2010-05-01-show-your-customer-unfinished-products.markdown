<p>In what I would call the worst-case scenario,a customer&rsquo;s involvement in a project could consist of setting up initial requirements at the start of a project and then viewing the results at the end of the project. This is of course not ideal for either the customer or the team developing the software.</p>
<p>In the next best scenario the customer could show up at the beginning and end of each release. This is still not enough. Why? At that point there is no slack remaining. What if the customer doesn&rsquo;t like how something was done? What if there was a misunderstanding? What if the customer has something new that your design makes as a new requirement?</p>
<p>If the customer doesn&rsquo;t like your design and you need to go and redo things, your time and the customer&rsquo;s money has been wasted. I know it can be challenging with some customers, but you want to show them what you&rsquo;re working on before you&rsquo;re done. The customer can make changes based on what you show them.</p>
<p>When you mock up a design for something, show your customer. When you first set up the screen, show it to them before you&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>The customer will like that you&rsquo;re keeping them involved. They can make changes now rather than at the last minute, which is good for you. You get the benefit of having questions answered. You can remove guesswork. If you got it wrong, don&rsquo;t worry, the important thing is that it didn&rsquo;t release that way.</p>
<p>Disconnects between the customer and the development team can happen easily. The customer doesn&rsquo;t know why things take so long or even what you&rsquo;re working on if you don&rsquo;t tell them. You may feel like the customer is sabotaging your success if you wait until the end to show them what you&rsquo;ve created. Get your constructive feedback earlier and you and the customer will be happier about the results.</p>
<p>This applies to agile teams as well. If you&rsquo;re an agile team you may think that your weekly iteration gives your customer enough involvement since you can show them at the end of an iteration. It isn&rsquo;t enough. You need your customer&rsquo;s feedback throughout the iteration. In order for agile development to work you need to make sure that you are <em><strong>done</strong>&nbsp;</em> with your work at the end of every iteration. You can&rsquo;t be done until your customer signs off on it, so make sure you&rsquo;re getting them to sign off on things during the iteration. If you don&rsquo;t you&rsquo;ll never finish an iteration on time.</p>
