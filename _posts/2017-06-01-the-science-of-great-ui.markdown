<p>Not a day goes by when I can avoid thinking about UI and UX. Sometimes, I’m thinking about real-world scenarios, but as a developer, I also have to consider it in the applications that I build. As developers, we really cannot avoid it, even when there’s someone else in charge of the UI/UX of the application we’re building. Thanks to Mark Miller’s DevIQ course, <a href="http://app.deviq.com/courses/the-science-of-great-ui" target="_blank">The Science of Great UI</a>, I’ve been able to learn a lot more about UI and UX. It’s an in-depth course which really does focus on the science behind building good user interfaces. It’s not just a prescriptive, do X, Y, Z in this certain scenario, the course explains the science that’s dictating what makes a user interface good or bad. I learned a ton from this course!</p> <p>As some of you may know, a few close friends of mine and I created a training company called DevIQ. We’re all passionate about technology and improving how people learn; we’re frequent speakers at conferences, run training workshops, and mentor other technology experts. As we create new courses, we’ll be posting them to <a href="http://deviq.com/" target="_blank">DevIQ.com</a>, so be on the lookout for more great courses all the time!</p> <p>So once you’ve watched this course, you’ll be in the same boat that I’m in, waiting for Mark to produce the follow-up course <strong>Design Like a Pro</strong>. He’s doing a series of courses on design that will help you and me become better at designing great user interfaces.</p> <h3>Table of Contents</h3> <ul> <li>Introduction  <li>Converting Light Into Understanding  <li>Certainty, Ambiguity, Context  <li>Grouping  <li>Symbols  <li>Cognitive Load  <li>Granularity  <li>Visual Search  <li>Background and Foreground  <li>Information Relevance and Emphasis  <li>Noise, Weak Signal, and Clarity  <li>Recognition vs. Recall, Orienteering, and Paths  <li>Responsiveness &amp; The Feedback Loop  <li>Discoverability  <li>Efficiency in Thought &amp; Motion </li></ul> <p>Go check out Mark’s course, <a href="http://app.deviq.com/courses/the-science-of-great-ui" target="_blank">The Science of Great UI</a>!</p> <p><a href="http://app.deviq.com/courses/the-science-of-great-ui" target="_blank"><img title="ScienceOfGreatUIThumb" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="ScienceOfGreatUIThumb" src="/images/files/ScienceOfGreatUIThumb.png" width="500" height="280"></a></p>
