<p>Yesterday, I was working with my dev team, and some people came across some C# 7 code. Specifically, they were seeing some code using Pattern Matching, and weren’t sure about it. Not everyone was familiar with C# 7, a failing on my part. If you’re also not familiar with all of the new features in C# 7, I’d recommend checking out my <a href="https://app.deviq.com/courses/whats-new-in-c-7" target="_blank">What’s New in C# 7 course on DevIQ</a>. In the course, I go through all of the new features of C# 7, explaining both how they work and when to use them.</p><p>I talk regularly at conferences about C#, and have given talks on C# 6, C# 7, and the combination of the two. When I ask people if they’re using a version of C#, most people acknowledge they are, but when I ask about specific features, most hands drop. I find that many developers are not using the features made available to them until long after it’s available to them. Don’t miss out on these!</p><p><strong>As C# grows it’s important to stay up-to-date on everything that it offers you! Check out my course today and get your quick-start to using the </strong><a href="https://app.deviq.com/courses/whats-new-in-c-7" target="_blank"><strong>new features in C# 7</strong></a><strong>!</strong></p><strong>
