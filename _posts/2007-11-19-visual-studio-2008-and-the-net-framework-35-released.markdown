<p>In my attempt to add to the monotony, I'll say that not long ago Visual Studio 2008 was released to all of the MSDN subscribes. With the news spreading so quickly the downloads are all taking forever. Good luck! <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/" target="_blank">Scott Guthrie</a>, as usual, posted some <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/11/19/visual-studio-2008-and-net-3-5-released.aspx" target="_blank">good content about this Visual Studio 2008 release</a>. There will be some trial versions of the professional available in the not too distant future. <img src="http://www.microsoft.com/express/images/menu/VSE_Menu_Header_Logo.jpg" alt="" width="208" height="132" align="right" />You can also read a nice tour of all of the new features added into this new release. Scott wrote short overviews for a lot of the information and linked to more in-depth descriptions of these features. Make sure you follow those links if you're not well informed about this release.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/express/download/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Express Editions</a> and&nbsp; the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=333325FD-AE52-4E35-B531-508D977D32A6&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank">.NET Framework 3.5 runtime</a> are currently available for download. These downloads should work better than the MSDN full version of Visual Studio. These are not multiple gigabyte files and also are probably not as popular right now.</p>
<p>I've been hearing complaints all day about difficulties trying to download it. I am assuming the problems result from too many users attempting to download. Good luck and enjoy some of the great new features.</p>
