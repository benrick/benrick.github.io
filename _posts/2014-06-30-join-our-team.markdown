<p>You are correct. I don&rsquo;t usually do recruiting posts on my blog, however, I am guessing that my blog readers are people who might be interested in working with me. <a href="/post/I-Joined-Clear-Measure.aspx" target="_blank">I joined Clear Measure</a> a couple of months ago, which is a company <a href="http://jeffreypalermo.com/blog/how-i-left-headspring-and-started-clear-measure-inc/" target="_blank">started</a> by <a href="http://jeffreypalermo.com/" target="_blank">Jeffrey Palermo</a> and <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/mark-stavrou/1a/58/656" target="_blank">Mark Stavrou</a>. Primarily based in Austin, we are starting to build a pocket of developers in Northeast Ohio. Our team up here is currently remote, but we are hoping to get enough people to merit some suburban office space for our team.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/brendoneus">Let me know</a> if you&rsquo;re in the Northeast Ohio area and want to play buzzword bingo with this card</strong>:</p>

<p>We all love buzzword bingo! Right? right?</p>
<p>You can always check here for <a href="http://www.clear-measure.com/careers/" target="_blank">Clear Measure&rsquo;s current openings</a>. Even when we don&rsquo;t have a listed position open, contact me anyway, because I firmly believe that a company should always be hiring. The best people don&rsquo;t come along every day. That&rsquo;s how I ended up working with <a href="https://twitter.com/ropog" target="_blank">Todd Ropog</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/kevinkuebler" target="_blank">Kevin Kuebler</a> years ago. They were the right people to join NimblePros.&nbsp;</p>
