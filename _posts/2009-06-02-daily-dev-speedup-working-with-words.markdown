<p>A lot of applications allow you to work with a group of text at a time. For the purposes of this post I'll call them "words". When I say a lot of applications this includes the powerful IDE called Notepad. This cool trick can be applied in a lot of different places. I am sure you'll figure out some interesting uses for this.</p>
<p>The key (literally) to achieving this productivity from working with words is the <em>Ctrl</em> key. By holding it in combination with other keys we can work with words. The three main things I want to discuss when working with words are: moving from over a word, selecting a word, and deleting a word. As you can probably guess to move through a word you use <em>Ctrl</em> with an arrow key. To select a word you hold <em>Ctrl</em> as well as <em>Shift</em> while using the arrow key. To delete a word you can use <em>Ctrl</em>&nbsp; in combination with <em>Delete</em> or <em>Backspace</em>. (Yes, I lumped delete and backspace together even though they are technically separate operations.)</p>
<p>Here is a demonstration in Visual Studio showing how to move over words followed by select words followed by deleting words.</p>
