<p>Ladies, gentlemen, boys, girls, and anyone who doesn't fit in any of those categories this includes, ruffians, riffraff, hooligans, and probably some other people listen up. I have wonderful news to announce. I am finally moving my blog off of aspadvice.com, the site which has graciously given my blog a home for over two years now.</p>
<p>I welcome everyone to this new experience known for now as...... Brendan Enrick's Blog.</p>
<p>What does this mean to you? Well it means that if you ever visit my blog and read a post you'll have a nice look and feel. It also means better integration for me using Windows Live Writer.</p>
<p>Will any of what you've said above change? Yes, of course it will change. Doesn't everything? Perhaps I will switch to another program for writing my blogs. Until that day comes though who knows.</p>
<p>All crazed lunacy aside, this is my new blog. I hope everyone likes it and enjoys reading it.</p>
<p>Thank you and good night........ um....... I mean morning. It is after all 9:25 AM here right now.</p>
