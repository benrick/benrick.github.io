<p>I was recently on <a href="http://www.developerfusion.co.uk/">Developer Fusion</a> when I noticed some simple and easy to use <a href="http://www.developerfusion.co.uk/utilities/convertcsharptovb.aspx" target="_blank">C# to VB</a> and <a href="http://www.developerfusion.co.uk/utilities/convertvbtocsharp.aspx" target="_blank">VB to C#</a> converters. It is not difficult to translate code from one language to the other, but sometimes I'll want to test out a code snippet from some site and it is in VB. I use C# and I don't want to have to sit there translating 20 lines of code, and I also don't want to go and get an expensive converter. These seem to do a reasonable job converting between the two languages. I've used them a fair amount so far, and I haven't run into a problem with them yet. I suggest you check them out and bookmark them. They've saved me plenty of time already.</p>
