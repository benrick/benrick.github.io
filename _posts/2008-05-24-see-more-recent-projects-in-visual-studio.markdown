<p>I usually only open between 5 and 10 Visual Studio projects on a regular basis, so I love the recent projects section of the Visual Studio Start Page. The problem is that when I add projects to my solutions they get added into the recent projects window and it makes it so I now have to go get my solution open from the file system. This irritates me quite a bit.</p>
<p>So for anyone who wants to increase the Recent Projects section of the Visual Studio Start Page from this.</p>

<p>Just open up the Tools menu item at the top select options and follow the instructions on this nice screen shot.</p>

<p>And enjoy <em>not</em> digging into the file system to get to that solution file.</p>
