<p><img src="/image.axd?picture=2013%2f10%2fCalendarCover.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>If you were a fan of any of the <a href="/post/Feature-Creep.aspx" target="_blank">previous</a> <a href="/post/Boy-Scout-Rule.aspx" target="_blank">Software</a> <a href="/post/Waterfail.aspx" target="_blank">Craftsmanship</a> <a href="/post/Single-Responsibility-Principle.aspx" target="_blank">Calendars</a> or just liked the <a href="/post/Copy-Paste-Programming.aspx" target="_blank">posts</a> about <a href="/post/Calendar-Coder.aspx" target="_blank">some</a> of the <a href="/post/Duct-Tape-Coder.aspx" target="_blank">months</a>, you'll be glad to know that we continued making a new one. We are continuing to alternate between Good Practices and Bad Practices, so this year (being the 4th) is a calendar of anti-patterns.</p>
<p>Each month of this calendar shows something that you shouldn't do, but plays it off as a good thing. You'll also find an interesting, related quote and a definition of the anti-pattern on each month.</p>
