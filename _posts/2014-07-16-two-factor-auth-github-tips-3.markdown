<p>I’ve got a <a href="http://pluralsight.com/training/Courses/TableOfContents/github-windows-developers" target="_blank">Pluralsight course about using GitHub</a> that went live yesterday, so I thought I would post a few quick tips to help anyone using GitHub or GitHub for Windows and also promote my course.</p> <p>One of the main concerns that I hear from businesses about hosting their code off-site is security. While nothing can ever be “completely secure”, you can help yourself a little bit by enabling two factor authentication in GitHub. It uses most two factor authentication apps, so you can set up any device as the second key.</p> <p>Once you’ve got it set up, GitHub for Windows will even prompt you for that auth token after you type your password. Annoying to have an extra step? Yes. More secure? Yes.</p> <p><a href="/images/files/GitHubTwoFactorAuth.png"><img title="GitHubTwoFactorAuth" style="border-left-width: 0px; max-width: 100%; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="GitHubTwoFactorAuth" src="/images/files/GitHubTwoFactorAuth_thumb.png"></a> </p> <p>I hope that tip helps someone keep their GitHub account safer, and if you want to learn more about GitHub, please <a href="http://pluralsight.com/training/Courses/TableOfContents/github-windows-developers" target="_blank">check out my Pluralsight course</a>.</p>
