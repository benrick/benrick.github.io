<p>I am very grateful to be speaking at my 6th <a href="http://codemash.org/" target="_blank">CodeMash</a>. I’ve again been selected to present a precompiler on Software Craftsmanship (a topic I am very passionate about). I hope that everyone can attend my workshops. I’ve got two of them again, so I’ll be spending a full day working with software craftsman coding. We’ll be focusing as always on practicing, pairing, testing, and applying all of these effectively. We’ll work through ways you can use practice to learn new concepts and patterns to improve your skills at building great software.</p> <p><a href="/images/files/SpeakerSelection.png"><img title="SpeakerSelection" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="SpeakerSelection" src="/images/files/SpeakerSelection_thumb.png" width="881" height="149"></a></p> <p>Once again, <a href="http://ardalis.com/" target="_blank">Steve Smith</a> and I will be presenting these Precompiler workshops together, so you’re sure to have a blast!</p> <p>Our sessions are usually held back-to-back, so that you can attend the beginner session in the morning and follow it up with the intermediate session in the afternoon. <a href="/post/CodeMash-2014-Software-Craftsmanship-Precompiler-Workshop" target="_blank">Last year</a>, our afternoon session had to have extra chairs and tables brought in for all of the extra people who showed up. My goal every year is to put on a workshop that will be the highpoint of your CodeMash! Join us for some great coding, learning, and practicing of your software skills.</p> <p>If you’re in the Northeast Ohio area and want to learn more about software craftsmanship, you should check out <a href="http://hudsonsc.com" target="_blank">HudsonSC</a>. Our <a href="http://hudsonsc1014.eventbrite.com" target="_blank">October meeting</a> has been scheduled already. We meet on the third Wednesday of every month in Hudson, Ohio.</p>
