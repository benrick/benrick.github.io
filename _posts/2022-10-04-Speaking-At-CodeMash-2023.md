I am very excited and honored to announce that 2 of my workshops have been accepted at CodeMash 2023! This will be my 10th year speaking at CodeMash (including times as a secondary speaker). I'm looking forward to making it back to this event, which I've not attended for years due to the global pandemic.

If you'll be attending the event, be sure to say "hello" to me in the hallways of the event or before/after one of my pre-compiler workshops.

## Session Details

If you're wondering about my workshops for the event, I'll be doing 2 workshops to help people build up their TDD skills, and I'll have an awesome co-speaker helping me make these workshops awesome!
