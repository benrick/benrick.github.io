<p>So I haven't had a lot of problems with Vista. There have been some slight issues including <a href="http://aspadvice.com/blogs/name/archive/2008/03/19/Vista-64-Install-Requires-a-DVD-Device-Driver.aspx" target="_blank">this one</a> I blogged about recently. I think windows DreamScene is very cool, but I of course of more than one monitor attached to my computer. Okay, I can understand that they might have difficulty displaying the DreamScene video on both monitors, but not even allowing it to run because I have my desktop extended is absurd.</p>
<p>I would just like to be able to display it on the primary monitor or something. Perhaps let me pick a monitor and tell me only 1 monitor is allowed. instead of saying that I can't use it at all. I had to disable my second monitor to get DreamScene running.</p>
<p>If DreamScene and a second monitor are enabled at the same time, you'll see this nice popup from Windows.</p>

<p>And when you click to see more information, it gives you this nice error message.</p>

<p>Thanks guys.</p>
<p>How hard would it be to make DreamScene only run on 1 of the 2 monitors? Honestly here. let me choose a solid color background color even for the extra monitor(s).</p>
<p>One other request that gripes me a bit. I have plenty of backgrounds I like. I use a Gadget which changes my desktop background at a regular interval, but I wish this were a built in feature of windows. It really shouldn't be that hard, and it is certainly easier than DreamScene.</p>
<p>Have a great day!</p>
