<p>For those of you who do not read <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/default.aspx">Scott Guthrie&rsquo;s Blog</a>, you really should. I know that any time I need to write JavaScript I switch out of Visual Studio, but I will not have to with Visual Studio 2008. It is supposed to have much better support for JavaScript development. Even Intellisense. For anyone interested you should check out this recent blog entry from Scott Guthrie which gives a lot of cool information about <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/06/21/vs-2008-javascript-intellisense.aspx" target="_blank">Visual Studio 2008&rsquo;s JavaScript Intellisense</a>.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to start using VS 2008. It has a lot of great features I plan on getting a lot of use out of.</p>
