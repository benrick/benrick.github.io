<p>I recently wrote an article for C# beginners in which I explain the <a href="http://aspalliance.com/1682_What_to_Know_About_Value_Types_and_Reference_Types_in_C" target="_blank">differences between value types and reference types in C#</a>. It was published on <a href="http://aspalliance.com/" target="_blank">ASP Alliance</a> today. If you're new to C# or are even a little fuzzy on these concepts, I recommend you check it out. Please offer some feedback good or bad. I really do read and appreciate feedback I receive. I try to improve what I write based on what others tell me.</p>
<p>I've seen so many people run aground with errors stemming from misunderstandings about and just forgetting the importance of value and reference types.</p>
<p>Good day and happy programming!</p>
