<p>Just in case you missed the blog post from Scott Guthrie yesterday, I will post this.</p>
<p><a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/10/16/asp-net-mvc-beta-released.aspx" target="_blank">Scott Guthrie's MVC Beta Announcement</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=A24D1E00-CD35-4F66-BAA0-2362BDDE0766&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank">ASP.NET MVC Beta Download</a></p>
<p>One of my favorite little added bonuses of using IDEs is that I get a lot of helpers that generate code and files for me. If I call a method that doesn't exist I am able to have a stub of the method automatically generated. In the ASP.NET MVC beta they've added a new menu for adding views.</p>
<p>The Add View window it brings looks extremely useful. I look forward to using that to create my views. It handles strongly-typed views and MasterPage selection.</p>
<p>Overall it looks like a nice release.</p>
<p>For those of you who want to deploy using ASP.NET MVC keep in mind that Scott says this in his post.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today's ASP.NET MVC Beta release comes with an explicit "go-live" license that allows you to deploy it in production environments.&nbsp; The previous preview releases also allowed go-live deployments, but did so by not denying permission to deploy as opposed to explicitly granting it (which was a common source of confusion).&nbsp; Today's release is clearer about this in the license.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good day and enjoy ASP.NET MVC's newest release.</p>
