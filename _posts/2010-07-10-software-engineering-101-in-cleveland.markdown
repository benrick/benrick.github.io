<p>This week I&rsquo;ll be speaking at a free day-long event for developers to improve their software engineering skills. The event is being held at the Microsoft office in Independence, Ohio. Microsoft is hosting the event being organized by the <a href="http://hudsonsc.com/" target="_blank">Hudson Software Craftsmanship group</a> and <a href="http://nimblepros.com/" target="_blank">NimblePros consulting services</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be kicking off the event with my main topic: Principles of Object Oriented Programming. Other topics will include: SOLID Software Development, Software Testing, and Specification Driven Testing. In the afternoon we&rsquo;ll be doing Hands-On Exercises.</p>
<p>There are only a dozen seats remaining for the event scheduled for July 16, 2010. We&rsquo;ll be starting in the morning at 8:30 AM and running until 4:00 PM. We&rsquo;re looking forward to seeing you there!</p>
