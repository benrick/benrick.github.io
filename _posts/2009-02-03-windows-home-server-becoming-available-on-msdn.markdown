Well, it doesn't include it. I looked in the "servers" section, the "operating systems" section, and when that failed I asked Google. I read the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/msdnsubscriptions/default.aspx" target="_blank">Official MSDN Subscriptions Blog</a>, which contained a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/msdnsubscriptions/archive/2008/01/14/windows-home-server-a-follow-up.aspx" target="_blank">post about Windows Home Sever</a>. It seems that including Windows Home Server was considered and rejected. Thanks to the post on that blog, a lot of feedback was received requesting its inclusion as well as information about why it was not included. Thanks to an update on that post, I know that a year ago they said they would be reconsidering it based on the feedback.</p>
<p>I still don't see it as an available download, but luckily there has been follow up information on the issue. Philip Churchill posted about <a href="http://mswhs.com/2008/11/03/whs-coming-to-msdn/" target="_blank">WHS Coming to MSDN</a> a couple of months ago. Now, I sit around waiting for Microsoft to deliver this awesome product to their faithful MSDN crew. I just used one recently, and it is very easy and nice to use. I now see what all of the hype has been about. For once I think the hype was not exaggerating the product. At least not much.</p>
<p>I look forward to the release of Windows Home Server on MSDN. I hope you do also, since I will most certainly write about it once they release it.</p>
