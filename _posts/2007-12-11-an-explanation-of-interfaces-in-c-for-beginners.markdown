<p>I recently authored an article for <a href="http://aspalliance.com/" target="_blank">ASP Alliance</a> in which I describe <a href="http://aspalliance.com/1516_Understanding_Interfaces_in_C" target="_blank">the basics of how interfaces work and how to use and create them in C#</a>. I tried not to describe in great detail exactly how everything works, because that will prevent beginners from understanding how interfaces may be used. I plan to write further about this topic, but I think it a mistake to begin with even an intermediate description of a topic without at least giving a beginners explanation first. I'll be doing some more advanced examples for my next article on interfaces, so look forward to one in the not too distant future.</p>
<p>I am not sure how the rest of you feel, but I think that interfaces are an amazing tool. I try to use interfaces when possible, because it makes code much more maintainable.</p>
<p>Let me know what you think and any suggestions for future articles.</p>
<p>As always, thanks for reading!</p>
