<p>One web comic I commonly read is <a href="http://xkcd.com/">xkcd</a>. It is a great comic that has a lot of good computer as well as just nerdy jokes. It has a great comic about SQL injection attacks and why you need to sanitize your database inputs. This is a lesson in what to not name your child.</p>

<p>I hope that everyone who reads this gets this joke. Quite amazing. This comic is full of great stuff like this. Try to not waste your day reading this grade A material.</p>
