I've been creating a series of videos on YouTube about cool things in VS Code that you may not know about. Check out the [DevChatter YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/devchatter) if you want to see all of my videos, or you can see the [VS Code Tips](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfRLz7YT8uz36VdgSMATJj2chNtbixokI) Playlist.
