## Outro

Thanks for participating in this year's .NET Advent Calendar! I hope you enjoy the next couple of weeks of these dotnet posts from members of the developer community.

If you don't know me, my name is Brendan Enrick, and I'm a regular speaker at conferences and user groups. I host a live coding streams and create coding videos on my [DevChatter Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/DevChatter) and [DevChatter YouTube](https://www.YouTube.com/c/DevChatter) channels. You can also follow me as [@Brendoneus](https://twitter.com/brendoneus) on Twitter or [@Brendoneus@Our.DevChatter.com](https://our.devchatter.com/@Brendoneus) on Mastodon.

Lastly, and most importantly, I want to be sure to thank the organizers and other authors of the [.NET Advent Calendar](https://dotnet.christmas/) for making this an awesome bit of fun for everyone!
