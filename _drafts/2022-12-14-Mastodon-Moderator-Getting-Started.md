Welcome! And thanks for helping make the Fediverse a better place! Whether you created your own instance, volunteered to help moderate an instance, or you were "volunteered" by an instance admin, you'll be able to help keep your Mastodon instance running better!

## Navigating to the Moderation Section

When you're logged into the site, you click in the **Preferences** at `/settings/preferences/` link on the side to bring up the backend. Once there, you can open up the **Moderation** section, or you can navigate by going to `/admin/reports`.
