  Hey chatter! My name is Brendan, and I'm the host and creator of the DevChatter community! It's great that you're here.
</p>

I am a lifelong coder who started coding as a kid and loves creating new things. I work mostly in C# and JavaScript, but I don't work exclusively with those languages. In recent years, I've worked with Python, Java, C++ and TypeScript, and I've used other languages before those.

## Want to Work with Brendan?

I am an independent consultant who does both project work for companies as well as training, mentoring, and coaching on development teams (the whole team, not just the programmers). You can send me a DM on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/brendoneus) or join my [DevChatter Programming Discord](https://discord.gg/aQry9jG) where you can ask about my availability in the `#Jobs` channel or send me a DM.

## Brendan on Other Platforms

You can find me in a few places on the Internet:

- On my [DevChatter YouTube Programming Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/DevChatter)
- On my [DevChatter Twitch Programming Channel](https://www.Twitch.tv/DevChatter)
- On my [Pluralsight Profile](https://www.pluralsight.com/authors/brendan-enrick)

Happy Coding!
